**About Us.** 
We are a small scale community based initiative with the goal of building resilience via automation. We believe that there is a large community of people who would love to contribute  to building a greener and more sustainable Ottawa, if only they had the time and resources. Thatâ€™s why we are coming together to address this problem with automation. By providing people with low cost, space efficient, low labour, and sustainable urban agriculture solutions we hope to engage more people in the task of building local food resilience.
